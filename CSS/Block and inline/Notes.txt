Block vs Inline

Most of the elements that you have learned about so far are block elements. In other words, their default style is display: block.
By default, block elements will appear on the page stacked atop each other, each new element starting on a new line.

Inline elements, however, do not start on a new line. They appear in line with whatever elements they are placed beside. 
A clear example of an inline element is a link, or <a> tag.

Divs and Spans
Div is a block-level element by default. It is commonly used as a container element to group other elements. 
Divs allow us to divide the page into different blocks and apply styling to those blocks.

Span is an inline-level element by default. It can be used to group text content and inline HTML elements 
for styling and should only be used when no other semantic HTML element is appropriate.
