Ancor element -
   To create a link in HTML, we use the anchor element. An anchor element is defined by wrapping the text or another 
   HTML element we want to be a link with an <a> tag.
   
   An HTML attribute gives additional information to an HTML element and always goes in the element’s opening tag. 
   An attribute is usually made up of two parts: a name, and a value; however, not all attributes require a value. In our 
   case, we need to add a href (hyperlink reference) attribute to the opening anchor tag. The value of the href attribute is 
   the destination we want our link to go to.

Absolute and Relative Links

  Absolute Links

  Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links. A typical absolute link will be made up of
  the following parts: protocol://domain/path. An absolute link will always contain the protocol and domain of the destination.
  
  Relative Links

  Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links. Relative links do not include the domain name,
  since it is another page on the same site, it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we created the link on.

   A Metaphor
   Absolute and relative links are a tricky concept to build a good mental model of, a metaphor may help:

  Think of your domain name (town.com) as a town, the directory in which your website is located (/museum) as a museum,
  and each page on your website as a room in the museum (/museum/movie_room.html and /museum/shops/coffee_shop.html). 
  Relative links like ./shops/coffee_shop.html are directions from the current room (the museum movie room /museum/movie_room.html) 
  to another room (the museum shop). Absolute links, on the other hand, are full directions including the protocol (https), 
  domain name (town.com) and the path from that domain name (/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html): https://town.com/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html.

    Images
    To display an image in HTML we use the <img> element. Unlike the other elements we have encountered,  
    the <img> element is self-closing. Empty, self-closing HTML elements do not need a closing tag.
    <img src="images/dog.jpg">

    Parent Directories
   To go to the parent directory we need to use two dots in the relative filepath like this: ../. Let’s see this in action, 
   within the body of the about.html file, add the following image below the heading we added earlier:
    <img src="../images/dog.jpg"> 

    Alt attribute
    The alt attribute is used to describe an image. It will be used in place of the image if it cannot be loaded. 
     It is also used with screen readers to describe what the image is to visually impaired users.
